/** Trait for field type, essentially type level representations of a number of small primes and 1. The choice of
  * primes is essentially the largest prime which will can be represented by a bitset of 4,8,16,32 and 128 bits, then
  * every 128 bits after that. The largest prime we consider is 1279, which can be represented by a bitset with 1280
  * bits (bitsets are internally represented as Array[Long], so size must be a multiple of 64 bits).
  *
  * The choice of 1279 has the convenient property that 1279 pow 3 is less than the max value of a signed integer. As
  * we often deal with signatures of 3 factors, being certain that the product of the factors is an Int (rather than a
  * BigInt) is useful for optimisation.
